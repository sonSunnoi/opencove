**Cove is an AI coding workspace born for the "Post-Chat Era".**

When AI coding evolves from simple "chat" to complex "task orchestration," traditional IDE terminals and chat windows fall short. Cove provides an **Infinite Deep Space Canvas**, allowing you to orchestrate multiple AI agents, manage task flows, and reorganize fragmented context spatially within a single view.

Say goodbye to chaotic tab switching. Embrace a **visual, spatial** paradigm for AI collaboration.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌌 Infinite Deep Space Canvas
Organize your work on a virtually infinite 2D plane. Arrange terminals, agent sessions, and task cards freely like a mind map.
- **Spatial Memory**: Leverage your spatial cognition—set top-left for "backend services" and bottom-right for "frontend debugging."
- **Global Overview**: Seamlessly zoom out for a macroscopic view of your project or dive into microscopic details.
- **Persistent Viewport**: Your every drag and zoom is saved. Next time you open it, you're right back at the "scene of the crime."

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration
Don't limit your agents to a single sidebar. In Cove, you can run multiple agent instances simultaneously.
- **Parallel Execution**: Run **Claude Code** on the left for architectural refactoring, while **Codex** on the right writes unit tests.
- **Visualized State**: Intuitively see whether each agent is thinking, executing commands, or waiting for confirmation.
- **Unified Protocol**: Whether it's Claude or OpenAI under the hood, Cove manages their PTY lifecycle with a unified protocol.

### 🔮 Cyber-Glass Immersive UI
A **Deep Space Cyber-Glass** design language crafted for developers.
- **Deep Space Aesthetics**: Deep dark background + neon glow, focused coding without eye strain.
- **Frosted Glass Texture**: Modern translucent containers with clear hierarchy and a breathing feel.
- **Interaction Details**: Collision detection, smooth animations, magnetic alignment—every interaction is polished.

## 🚀 Why Cove?

| Traditional Mode | Cove Mode |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Chat**: Context is pushed away by chat history, hard to backtrack. | **Spatial Nodes**: Key information stays permanently on the canvas, WYSIWYG. |
| **Single Task**: Chat with one agent about one thing at a time. | **Multi-Threaded**: Command multiple agents on different modules in parallel. |
| **Black Box**: Unsure what the agent is secretly doing in the terminal. | **Transparent Oversight**: Every terminal operation by the agent is shown in real-time PTY nodes. |
